### 1. Introduction to Wireshark – Packet Analysis for SOC Analysts

🎯 Objective
    Wireshark is a powerful packet analysis tool used by SOC analysts to investigate network traffic. I will learn the interface, how to capture packets, apply filters, and identify suspicious communication patterns.

 Wireshark Use Cases for SOC Analysts
   🔍 Incident Investigation: Analyze malicious traffic patterns (e.g., C2 communication, lateral movement)
   🕵️ Malware Analysis: Extract indicators like domains, IPs, and payloads from suspicious network behavior
   🚨 Threat Hunting: Detect anomalies like DNS tunneling, beaconing, or unauthorized FTP/SSH usage
   🛠️ Protocol Troubleshooting: Identify service failures, misconfigurations, or latency issues
